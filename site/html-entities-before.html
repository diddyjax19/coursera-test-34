			"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,or where the doer of the deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the mann ehois actually in the arena,whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;who strives valiantly;who errs, who comes short again and again,because there is no effort without errors and shortcoming;but who does actually strive to the deeds who knows great enthusiams,the great devotions:who spends himself in a &nbsp;worthy&nbsp;cause &quot; "
